              A contemporary mass setting which captures the jubilation and
              reverance of Catholic worship. Appropriate for Ordinary Time,
              Christmas, and Easter seasons; the Mass of Abundant Love is a
              singable, powerful expression of the joy and mystery of the Mass.

            <p>
              This was my first goal as a Catholic composer. To create
              responsorial psalms that were singable, powerful, and faithful to
              the text. Each one has been used in my own service and I'm proud
              to say our congregation sings these as loud as any song or hymn we
              use. <br /><br />
              The verses are written to meaningfully convey the message of the
              text while still remaining simple enough for a cantor to learn
              week to week. The melody is consistent between verses, and the
              range is accessible for all singers.
              <br /><br />
              I've written a responsorial psalm for nearly every Sunday in the
              three year cycle as well as select pieces for weddings and
              funerals. If you don't see the one you need, reach out and I
              probably have a copy I can send.

              |The Battle Is Won| <br /><br />
              Suitable for the conclusion of mass, this lively call to action
              declares, "You were made by the Father / You were saved by the Son
              / You are filled with the Spirit; now go and declare that the
              battle is won!"
              <br /><br />
              |Hungry|
              <br /><br />
              Scripture tells us that what we do for the least among us we do
              for Christ. This moving folk ballad captures that sentiment and
              challenges us to be Christ's love in our world,
              <br /><br />
              |Victory|
              <br /><br />
              A meditative hymn reminding us that our strength - our resilience
              - is from God.

              The liturgy of the Mass is beautiful. From "My God, my God, why
              have you abandoned me?" to "Let the Lord enter; he is king of
              glory.", these settings capture the strength, the anguish, and the
              hope behind every word.

          <span><h2>Hi, I'm Eric.</h2></span> I live in Houston, Texas with my
          fiance Stephanie and our dog Bella. I grew up in North Carolina,
          studied music at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and
          moved to Texas in 2015.<br /><br />When I'm not composing or
          performing, I enjoy playing basketball, spending time in nature, and
          traveling. I've visited 20 countries and more than half of the U.S.
          National Parks.<br /><br />I'm passionate about music, teaching
          others, and making a positive difference in the world. I hope you find
          something that enriches your service. Thank you for visiting.
